    "        - Print the item_cost and the total_cost.\n",
    "    - Now, if the total_cost is greater than 200, make a discount by 20% for this special customer!!\n",
    "6. Do not forget to handle any unexpected inputs from the users (Just cast the input values and catch the errors!!).\n",
    "7. Finally, ask the user if he want to repeat the same process from step 1 until 6 or not, Use the loops, but one of them ;)\n",
    "    - Note : The ask is after catching the errors.\n"
